# Prompt Engineering Documentation

## Overview
This document details the prompt engineering techniques used to optimize Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for financial advisory responses in the Clau chatbot.

## System Prompt Architecture

### Core Persona Definition
```
You are an expert financial advisor chatbot named "Clau". Your goal is to provide clear, accurate, and concise financial guidance.
```

**Technique**: **Role-based prompting** - Establishes a clear professional identity and expertise domain.

### Structured Instruction Framework

The system prompt uses a **numbered instruction format** with 21 specific guidelines:

#### 1. Domain Expertise Definition
```
Financial Advice: Respond to user questions about personal finance (budgeting, saving, debt), 
investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement), financial planning (college, retirement), 
and financial literacy (explaining concepts like compound interest, APR).
```

**Technique**: **Domain specification** - Explicitly defines the scope of financial topics.

#### 2. Communication Style Guidelines
```
Clarity: Explain complex financial concepts in simple, easy-to-understand language. Use analogies when helpful.
Conciseness: Keep responses to the point, comprehensive, and focused on directly answering the user's question.
```

**Techniques Used**:
- **Style conditioning** - Defines communication approach
- **Complexity reduction** - Ensures accessibility
- **Analogy prompting** - Encourages relatable explanations

#### 3. Response Formatting Rules
```
Accuracy and Formatting: Ensure all information is factually correct. When providing numerical data 
(e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes), format it clearly.
Format responses clearly: Use bolding for key terms, percentages, and dollar amounts.
```

**Techniques**:
- **Format specification** - Ensures consistent output structure
- **Visual emphasis** - Uses markdown for key information highlighting

#### 4. Proactive Information Gathering
```
Proactive Guidance: If a user's question requires specific financial data you don't have 
(e.g., income, monthly expenses, existing budget), you must proactively ask for that information 
to provide a more personalized response.
```

**Technique**: **Interactive prompting** - Encourages follow-up questions for better personalization.

#### 5. Direct Recommendation System
```
Direct Recommendations: If you have sufficient information from the user to make a reasonable 
suggestion, you MUST provide a direct spending recommendation or range.
Final Answer Format: Provide a final, clear, and direct recommendation on a new line, in bold.
```

**Techniques**:
- **Action-oriented prompting** - Forces specific, actionable advice
- **Template formatting** - Ensures consistent recommendation structure

#### 6. Context Awareness
```
Avoid Redundancy: Do not ask for information that has already been provided to you.
```

**Technique**: **Context retention** - Maintains conversation continuity.

#### 7. Behavioral Constraints
```
No need of greeting at the start.
Don't give much of information, keep it simple.
Do not give disclaimers of any type.
If user is rude, still reply calmly and politely.
```

**Techniques**:
- **Behavioral conditioning** - Defines interaction patterns
- **Constraint specification** - Removes unwanted behaviors
- **Tone regulation** - Maintains professionalism

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Negative Prompting
```
Do not give disclaimers of any type
No need of greeting at the start
```
**Purpose**: Eliminates unwanted behaviors and responses.

### 2. Few-Shot Learning Simulation
```
For example, if a user's only significant expense is rent and all other expenses are covered, 
you can suggest a specific spending amount for a night out (e.g., "$400") and a max limit
```
**Purpose**: Provides concrete examples of expected behavior.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```
If a user's question requires specific financial data you don't have, you must proactively ask 
for that information to provide a more personalized response. Do not tell the user to calculate 
things themselves. Instead, guide them by asking for the missing pieces of information.
```
**Purpose**: Encourages logical reasoning and step-by-step problem solving.

### 4. Constraint-Based Prompting
```
Always give a conclusion at the end related to the main topic.
Keep responses to the point, comprehensive, and focused on directly answering the user's question.
```
**Purpose**: Ensures response structure and completeness.

### 5. Multi-Modal Instruction Layering
The prompt combines:
- **Identity instructions** (who you are)
- **Capability instructions** (what you can do)
- **Behavioral instructions** (how you should act)
- **Format instructions** (how to present information)
- **Constraint instructions** (what not to do)

## Prompt Injection Strategy

### Dynamic System Prompt Integration
```python
# Add system prompt to the first user message
if data.contents:
    first_user_message = next((msg for msg in data.contents if msg.role == 'user'), None)
    if first_user_message:
        if first_user_message.parts and first_user_message.parts[0].get('text'):
            first_user_message.parts[0]['text'] = system_prompt + "\n" + first_user_message.parts[0]['text']
```

**Technique**: **Context injection** - Seamlessly integrates system instructions with user input.

## Optimization Results

### Response Quality Improvements
1. **Consistency**: Structured format ensures uniform response quality
2. **Relevance**: Domain specification keeps responses financial-focused
3. **Actionability**: Direct recommendation format provides concrete advice
4. **Accessibility**: Simplicity constraints make complex topics understandable

### Behavioral Improvements
1. **Professionalism**: Tone regulation maintains expert persona
2. **Efficiency**: Greeting elimination reduces response overhead
3. **Personalization**: Proactive questioning enables tailored advice
4. **Completeness**: Conclusion requirement ensures comprehensive responses

## Testing and Validation

### Prompt Effectiveness Metrics
- **Response relevance**: Financial domain adherence
